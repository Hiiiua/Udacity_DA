## Dataset

> I chose fordgobike, a bike sharing project, as my datasets. There are mainly four features involved in this analysis: travel_duration, start_time and user_type.


## Summary of Findings

> The records volume is growing.
> There is an pattern of bike using hours, two peak time are morning and everning rush hours.
> Subscribers has more travel times than customers, but shorter travel duration.
> Despite increasing usage count, the ratio of subscribers actually decreases.
> Most trvel duration are less than 30 minutes, which takes about 95% of all records.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> Two conclusions draw from the data of a project are important: if this is a promising project, anything else could do to make it even better?

>Usage count is increasing, and customers are turning into subscribers. These are good signals for a project. 
>By study the usage counts and average travel suration of different user types, we find some users are hiring bikes as sport or traveling tool rather than transportation tool. So in the long run, we could keep an eye on these users to decide if we want develope another type of bike and system targeting them.
